Yet another Platform as a Service
=================================

Image running a [yapaas][] daemon. This container will listen on a port
(default 13987) and participate in a yaPaaS cloud.

To update, grab the latest binary and copy it into this directory, before
`docker build`ing. This'll happen automatically anyway whenever a new version
of yapaas is released.
